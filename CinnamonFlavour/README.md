# Cinnamon Flavour cards

A themed pack focused on branding opponents. You get increasingly more powerful by mixing and matching combo pieces.

Branded players take a percentage of their max HP over time (default is 2 seconds). You can further increase brand damage and duration, and otherwise make it more advantageous to brand others.

Balanced around vanilla cards and meant to be played together with them.
